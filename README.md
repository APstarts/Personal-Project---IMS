Being a Chartered Accountant, I always wanted to get the feeling of having the ability to develop something of my own. Ever since when I was little I have always been inclined towards coding but never had the access to the resources. After becoming a Chartered Accountant I have ventured out into my journey to learn to code and my frst project is more of a linkage between my professional career in finance and my zeal to come up with something which can fix the problems of small store owners who can't afford to learn to use complex inventory management systems.
